# JsGEDCOM

A JavaScript GEDCOM parser, supporting GEDCOM v5.5 and v7.0.

See specifications on the official GEDCOM website : [https://gedcom.io/specs/](https://gedcom.io/specs/)

## Get Started

To run locally : `$ npm install && npm run build`. Then you can open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser. You can find test files in the `testfile` folder. These files are what we can call stress tests, which tries to cover the whole v5.5 and v7.0 GEDCOM specification.
